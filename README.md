## CS224W-project

- There are three data folders: data, ranking and prediction. Please put all the csv files you generated into one of these folders.
- Each method/algorithm should output the predicted label file (see the format in prediction folder)
- All the results will be run in main.py
- If a method outputs rating for each player, use output_prediction function to return a predicted label file (See example in main.py)
